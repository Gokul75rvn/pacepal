# Pacepal

Pacepal is an intelligent, adaptive habit and routine management platform designed to help individuals build consistency, break bad habits, and achieve personal growth. This project is structured using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) with Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap for styling.

## Core Features

- **Adaptive Habit Formation**: Automatically adjusts goals and frequencies based on user progress and stability.
- **Smart Reminders**: Gentle, context-aware nudges personalized based on time, location, and energy levels.
- **Behavioral Insights**: Data-driven analysis of trends, obstacles, and success patterns.
- **Visual Progress Tracking**: Heatmaps, streak trackers, and performance charts to inspire consistency.
- **Routine Builder**: Create and manage routines with defined flows and repetition cycles.
- **Gamification**: XP points, badges, levels, and community challenges to encourage accountability.
- **Cross-Platform Sync**: Real-time updates across devices with an offline-first design planned for future enhancement.
- **Security & Privacy**: End-to-end encryption, multi-factor authentication, and secure cloud storage.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React (Web), React Native (Mobile), Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, JWT for authentication, bcrypt for secure passwords
- **Database**: MongoDB, Mongoose
- **Tools**: VS Code, GitHub, Postman, MongoDB Atlas

## Development Roadmap

- **Phase 1 (Months 1-2)**: Core habit tracker & routine builder, basic reminders & streak visualizer, MongoDB schema setup.
- **Phase 2 (Months 3-4)**: Gamification mechanics, behavior insights module, secure authentication & cloud sync.
- **Phase 3 (Months 5-6)**: AI habit suggestions, cross-device synchronization, final testing & deployment.
- **Post-MVP (Future Updates)**: AI Habit Coach, offline mode with auto-sync, voice/wearable integration, community challenges & leaderboards.
